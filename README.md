# Data_Mining_Implementations
This repository collects all homework and projects of 2020 Spring RIT Computer Science Master's level course - CSCI-720-Big-Data Analytics. 

Homework 1: Metaprograme CSV file read
This home is about writing a Mentor program that runs it to produce a Trained program which can read a CSV file in current directory
and output its number of rows and columns. The empty rows and columns shall be ignored.
The programs were written in Python, with IDE of VScode and Anaconda Jupyton Notebook for visual testing. The packages used are Pandas,
Numpys.

Homework 2: Otsu Method for clustering 1D data into two groups, using bining method to quantize data and finding the best splitting point.
- This program graph the mixed variance from two groups based on different best splitting points. 
- For second cases, it used Regularization to help break ties if costs for each splitting point are close. 
- The program also compared the change of splitting point (bins) with different values of Alpha (a arg of Regularization).
